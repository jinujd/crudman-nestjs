# GitHub Discussion: Support for aligning with repository pattern

## **Title:**
Support for aligning with repository pattern

## **Description:**

### **Overview**

Currently, crudman-nestjs requires developers to manually inject TypeORM repositories via `additionalSettings.repo` for each CRUD action configuration. While this works, it doesn't align well with the widely-adopted **Repository Pattern** that many NestJS applications use for better separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

### **Current State**

The library currently works like this:

```typescript
@UseCrud({
  sections: {
    users: {
      model: User,
      list: { additionalSettings: { repo: userRepository } },
      details: { additionalSettings: { repo: userRepository } },
      create: { additionalSettings: { repo: userRepository } },
      update: { additionalSettings: { repo: userRepository } },
      delete: { additionalSettings: { repo: userRepository } }
    }
  }
})
export class UsersController extends CrudControllerBase('users') {}
```

This approach has several limitations:
- **Repetitive configuration** - same repository needs to be specified for each action
- **Manual dependency injection** - repositories must be manually passed in
- **Tight coupling** - controllers are directly coupled to specific repository instances
- **Testing complexity** - harder to mock repositories for unit testing
- **Inconsistent with NestJS patterns** - doesn't leverage NestJS's powerful DI system

### **Proposed Enhancement: Repository Pattern Support**

I'd like to propose adding first-class support for the Repository Pattern that would allow:

#### **1. Repository Interface Definition**
```typescript
export interface UserRepository {
  findAll(options?: FindOptions): Promise<User[]>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<User | null>;
  create(userData: CreateUserDto): Promise<User>;
  update(id: string, userData: UpdateUserDto): Promise<User>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### **2. Automatic Repository Resolution**
```typescript
@UseCrud({
  sections: {
    users: {
      model: User,
      repository: 'UserRepository', // Token-based injection
      // OR
      repository: UserRepository,   // Class-based injection
    }
  }
})
export class UsersController extends CrudControllerBase('users') {}
```

#### **3. Enhanced DI Integration**
The library could automatically resolve repositories through NestJS's DI container, eliminating manual configuration:

```typescript
// Repository implementation
@Injectable()
export class TypeOrmUserRepository implements UserRepository {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(User)
    private readonly userRepo: Repository<User>
  ) {}

  async findAll(options?: FindOptions): Promise<User[]> {
    return this.userRepo.find(options);
  }
  // ... other methods
}

// Module registration
@Module({
  providers: [
    { provide: 'UserRepository', useClass: TypeOrmUserRepository }
  ]
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

### **Benefits of Repository Pattern Support**

1. **Better Separation of Concerns** - Business logic separated from data access
2. **Improved Testability** - Easy to mock repository interfaces for unit tests
3. **Consistent with NestJS Patterns** - Leverages DI container properly
4. **Reduced Boilerplate** - No need to repeat repository configuration
5. **Framework Agnostic** - Could support different ORMs through repository interfaces
6. **Better Type Safety** - Repository interfaces provide compile-time type checking

### **Implementation Ideas**

1. **Repository Resolver**: Add a repository resolution mechanism that can work with:
   - String tokens (`'UserRepository'`)
   - Class constructors (`UserRepository`)
   - Direct instances (current behavior for backward compatibility)

2. **Adapter Enhancement**: Extend the current `OrmAdapter` interface to work with repository patterns while maintaining backward compatibility

3. **Configuration Simplification**: Allow repository specification at the section level instead of per-action

4. **Auto-Discovery**: Potentially auto-discover repositories based on naming conventions

### **Backward Compatibility**

This enhancement should maintain full backward compatibility with the current `additionalSettings.repo` approach while providing the new repository pattern as an opt-in feature.

### **Questions for Discussion**

1. Would this repository pattern support be valuable for the community?
2. Are there specific repository interface patterns you'd recommend?
3. Should we support both string tokens and class-based injection?
4. Any concerns about implementation complexity or performance impact?
5. Would you prefer this as a major version bump or as an additive feature?

I'd love to hear thoughts from the community and maintainers on this enhancement. This could significantly improve the developer experience and make crudman-nestjs even more aligned with modern NestJS application architecture patterns.

**Note:** This discussion proposal provides a comprehensive overview of the current state, clearly explains the proposed enhancement, shows concrete examples, and invites community feedback on the implementation approach.
